## Project goals.

## Project history.
Anoncoin was created in June 2013 as the first cryptocurrency with built-in support for I2P and Tor. Anoncoin was released in an entirely transparent manner and with a fair initial coin distribution. Though there was a small pre-mine of 4200 ANC for technical reasons, these coins were returned to the community through a public faucet, bounties, and give-a-ways.

Anoncoin was originally a fork of the Litecoin source code, and it now includes most aspects of Bitcoin Core 0.10. in addition to specific privacy-focused Anoncoin features.

Anoncoin was initially planning to implement Zerocoin in a trustless manner using RSA UFOs. Using RSA UFOs to implement the Zerocoin protocol turned out to be impractical, and we do not want to use a trusted setup. Instead, we want to take a different direction moving forward.

Anoncoin's founder returned to the project in October 2017 together with a small group of new developers. The project is currently in active development. Next release is planned for January 2018.
