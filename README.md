# Project repository
For now a place to store various project resources.

Here is a running list of ideas to prioritize:

* Create a project for people to maintain biaries for popular platforms
* Create Docker installation process
* Create a template file for pull requests for community developers to make changes
* Why is it hard to subscribe to the Anoncoin channel in Reddit?
* Move doc/tor.md to a separate Github project for running Anoncoin in tor
* Move multiwallet-qt.md to a separate Github project
* Move ./docker to a separate Github project
